# **WebGL Applications Repository**

## **Description**
This repository contains a collection of **WebGL-based applications** that demonstrate the power of 2D and 3D graphics on the web. Each project is designed to help you learn and master WebGL, from basic shapes and animations to advanced 3D rendering techniques. The applications cover a wide range of topics, including:

- **Basic WebGL Rendering**: Triangles, squares, and circles.
- **3D Graphics**: Cubes, prisms, spheres, and more.
- **Textures and Materials**: Applying textures to 2D and 3D objects.
- **Animations**: Rotations, translations, and dynamic movements.
- **Interactivity**: Keyboard, button, and slider controls.
- **Advanced Techniques**: Shaders, matrices, and perspective projections.

Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, this repository provides a hands-on approach to learning WebGL through practical examples and projects.
